# This program iterates through the numbers from 10 to 20 and prints out the sum of the perfect divisors for each
# number. Perfect divisors divide evenly into the number without remainder. This program should print out:
# 18, 12, 28, 14, 24, 24, 31, 18, 39, 20, 42
for number in range(10, 21):
    sum = 0
    for factor in range(1, number + 1):
        divisor = number / factor
        if number == divisor * factor:
            sum = sum + factor

    print(sum)

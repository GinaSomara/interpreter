# This program prints out all of the perfect divisors of 144. Perfect divisors divide evenly into a number without any
# remainder left over. The program finds them with a series of while loops. It should print out:
# 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24, 36, 48, 72, 144.
number = 1

        if remainder == number:
            print(number)
            remainder = 0
        if remainder > number:
            remainder = remainder - number
